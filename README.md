# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in python for fun.
 
 So I made the original in python in 2022 but I wanted to rewrite it so I made it in c++ but then I realized that libcurl is **the devil** so I rewrote it again in python.

# How to use
 ## Windows
  Install python then download the latest version of cbos then run install.cmd (it installs essential libraries)
 
  Then type `help` while in cbos

 ## Linux
  Install python then download cbos and run install.sh in your terminal with the command `sh install.sh`

  install.sh only works on arch based distros sadly.
