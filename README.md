# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in python for fun.
 
 So I made the original in python in 2022 but I wanted to rewrite it so I made it in c++ but then I realized that libcurl is **the devil** so I rewrote it again in python.

# How to use
 Install python then download the latest version of cbos then run install.cmd (it installs essential libraries)
 
 Then type `help` while in cbos

# Old releases
 To see releases before 3.0.0 please go to [the old repo.](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/C-Bos)
